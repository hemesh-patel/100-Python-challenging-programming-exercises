net_amount = 0
while True:
    a = raw_input()
    if not a:
        break
    s = a.split()
    if s[0] == 'D':
        net_amount = net_amount + int(s[1])
    elif s[0] == 'W':
        net_amount = net_amount - int(s[1])
print net_amount


#Alternative:

ac = 0
while True:
    x = input('>').split(' ')
    if x[0] == 'D':
        ac += int(x[1])
    elif x[0] == 'W':
        ac -= int(x[1])
    elif x[0] == 'done':
        break
print(ac)
