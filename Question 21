Question 21
Level 3

Question��
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps.
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
��
The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement
and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Example:
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
Then, the output of the program should be:
2

import math
x = 0
y = 0
while True:
    move = input('> ')
    if move == 'done':
        break
    try:
        move = move.split(' ')
        num = int(move[1])
        if move[0] == 'DOWN':
            y -= num
        elif move[0] == 'UP':
            y += num
        elif move[0] == 'RIGHT':
            x += num
        elif move[0] == 'LEFT':
            x -= num
        else:
            print('error')
    except:
        print('error')
print(math.sqrt((x**2) + (y**2)))
